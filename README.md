# TransformersWar
Demo Application.

Note: Use long click to delete a Transformer.

## Main ideas  
1. Create application with highly maintainable structure.
2. Move `ViewModel` initialization to Dagger2.Android modules;
3. Totally incapsulate `ViewModel` managment logic from final Activity/Fragment.
